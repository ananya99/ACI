## Abstract

The incredible diversity of visual systems in the animal kingdom is a result of millions of years of coevolution between eyes and brains, adapting to process visual information efficiently in different environments. We introduce the generative design of visual intelligence (GenVI), which leverages computational methods and generative artificial intelligence to explore a vast design space of potential visual systems and cognitive capabilities. By co-generating artificial eyes and brains that can sense, perceive, and enable interaction with the environment, GenVI enables the study of the evolutionary progression of vision in nature and the development of novel and efficient artificial visual systems. We anticipate that GenVI will provide a powerful tool for vision scientists to test hypotheses and gain new insights into the evolution of visual intelligence while also enabling engineers to create unconventional, task-specific artificial vision systems that rival their biological counterparts in terms of performance and efficiency.
