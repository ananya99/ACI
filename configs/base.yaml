defaults:
  # NOTE: There is a bug in hydra such that when you specify a config group (i.e. try to build a structured config),
  # you can't do nested interpolation (like if I include two defaults here, they can't interpolate such
  # that it resolves to each other). We'll fix this by explicitly setting the target in the instantiate call in code.
  - /MjCambrianConfig # Specify the config group (i.e. the class to instantiate this config as)

  - _self_ # Ordered such that subsequent defaults override self

  - env: env
  - trainer: trainer
  - evo: evo
  - hydra: hydra

  - required exp: "???"

expname: ${hydra:runtime.choices.exp}
logdir: ./logs/${now:%Y-%m-%d}/${expname}

seed: 0

# Not as easy as adding env@eval_env: ${env} to the defaults list because some required
# args are set in the downstream exp configs and these aren't carried over to eval_env
# when just loading the default env config. We set the eval env here, and subsequent
# configs can directly override the config.
eval_env: \${env}
