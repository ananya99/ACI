defaults:
  # NOTE: There is a bug in hydra such that when you specify a config group (i.e. try to build a structured config),
  # you can't do nested interpolation (like if I include two defaults here, they can't interpolate such
  # that it resolves to each other). We'll fix this by explicitly setting the target in the instantiate call in code.
  - /MjCambrianConfig # Specify the config group (i.e. the class to instantiate this config as)

  - _self_ # Ordered such that subsequent defaults override self
