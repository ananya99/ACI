# Not as easy as adding env@eval_env: ${env} to the defaults list because some required
# args are set in the downstream exp configs and these aren't carried over to eval_env
# when just loading the default env config. We set the eval env here, and subsequent
# configs can directly override the config.
# NOTE: \$ is used to escape the interpolation so that it's not evaluated until the
# eval_env is grabbed. This is because env may not be defined when this config is
# loaded.
