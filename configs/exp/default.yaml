# @package: _global_

defaults:
  # Below is how mazes are specified. Each maze should include the following in it's defaults list:
  # - /env_config/mazes@_here_: default/${env_config/mazes/default}
  # This refers to the default maze configuration defined below. At runtime, the user
  # can then specify a different default maze configuration, if desired. Furthermore,
  # the order below is important: mazes must come first because then the snippet 
  # mentioned earlier (specifically the ${env_config/mazes/default} part) won't be
  # resolved correctly. To specify a maze or multiple, you may run the following:
  # python <script> env_config/mazes=MAZE # defines one maze only
  # OR
  # python <script> env_config/mazes=[MAZE1,MAZE2,...]
  # TODO: currently is required, could loosen if we want to allow for no mazes
  - /env_config/mazes: "???"
  - /env_config/mazes/default: default

  # Similar to the mazes, you must also specify the animal configuration.
  - /env_config/animals: "???"
  - /env_config/animals/default: default
