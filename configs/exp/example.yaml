# @package _global_
# We need to specify the package as _global_ so that hydra knows to place all the
# overridden configs defined here at the root of the config

defaults:
  # Here we define all the mazes we want to use in this experiment in a list.
  # Note the override keyword; this is necessary since we define this attribute as a
  # requirement in the default file listed above
  # Also note that you can't include the same maze twice; it will overwrite the previous
  # definition since the mazes attribute is a dictionary
  - /env/mazes/I_MAZE_STATIC@env.mazes.I_MAZE_STATIC
  - /env/mazes/I_MAZE_STATIC@env.mazes.I_MAZE_STATIC2

  # We also need to define the eyes for the animal. We'll use the default eye to serve
  # as the base for the new eye.
  # This basically says load "eye.yaml" in ./env/animals/eyes and place it at
  # env.animals.animal_0.eyes.eye_1 in the config
  - /env/animals/eyes/eye@env.animals.animal_0.eyes.eye_1

  # Define another eye that has optics
  - /env/animals/eyes/eye@env.animals.animal_0.eyes.eye_2
  - /env/animals/eyes/optics/optics@env.animals.animal_0.eyes.eye_2.optics

  # We then include the default config (located at in the same folder as this file
  # i.e. configs/exp/maze_exp.yaml). This file defines required attributes we'll need
  # to specify here to set things up correctly. This _must_ come after the above
  # includes because it defines default values for specific config files and the above
  # files use those as interpolations in their default lists.

  # Same here; we define all the animals we want to use (in this case, just one)
  # We need to override the /env/animals field explicitly since we're changing the
  # default animal config
  - /env/animals@env.animals.animal_0: ${env/animals}
  - override /env/animals: point_1eye

  # Finally, we include _self_ such that all the configs defined herein will override
  # the files we've included above. This actually isn't necessary as hydra will
  # automatically append _self_ to the end of the list of defaults.
