# @package _global_
# We need to specify the package as _global_ so that hydra knows to place all the
# overridden configs defined here at the root of the config

defaults:
  # Here we define all the mazes we want to use in this experiment in a list.
  # Note the override keyword; this is necessary since we define this attribute as a
  # requirement in the default file listed above
  # Also note that you can't include the same maze twice; it will overwrite the previous
  # definition since the mazes attribute is a dictionary
  - /env/mazes/I_MAZE_STATIC@env.mazes.I_MAZE_STATIC
  - /env/mazes/I_MAZE_STATIC@env.mazes.I_MAZE_STATIC2
  - /env/mazes/I_MAZE_STATIC@env.mazes.I_MAZE_STATIC3
  - /env/mazes/I_MAZE_STATIC@env.mazes.I_MAZE_STATIC4

  # Same here; we define all the animals we want to use (in this case, just one)
  - /env/animals/point@env.animals.point

  # We also need to define the eyes for the animal. We'll use the default eye to serve
  # as the base for the single eye.
  - /env/animals/eyes/default@env.animals.point.eyes.point_0_eye_0: ${env/animals/eyes/default}

  # First, we'll include the default config (located at in the same folder as this file
  # i.e. configs/exp/exp.yaml). This file defines required attributes we'll need
  # to specify here to set things up correctly.
  - exp

  # Override the default environment to be a maze_env. We are using mazes above, and so
  # we need to specify the environment base which corresponds to the maze environment.
  # This will also register the env config group as an MjCambrianMazeEnvConfig
  - override /env: maze_env

  # Finally, we include _self_ such that all the configs defined herein will override
  # the files we've included above. This actually isn't necessary as hydra will
  # automatically append _self_ to the end of the list of defaults.
