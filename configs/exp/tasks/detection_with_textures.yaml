# @package _global_

# This task includes a goal and adversary. The goal and adversary are textured. The
# derived config must sent `custom.frequency` to the frequency of the texture
# that should be applied to the objects. By default, the textures are synchronized 
# between the goal and adversary, but this can be overridden by setting 
# env.objects.<object name>.custom.frequency directly for each object.

defaults:
  - /exp/tasks/detection@_here_

  # Adds two objects to the environment: a goal and an adversarial object
  - override /env/objects@env.objects.goal: textured_goal
  - override /env/objects@env.objects.adversary0: textured_adversary
  - override /env/objects@env.objects.adversary1: textured_adversary
  - override /env/objects@env.objects.adversary2: textured_adversary
  - override /env/objects@env.objects.adversary3: textured_adversary

custom:
  # The frequency of each textured object is shared for this task. You must set
  # custom.frequency in the derived config
  frequency: '???'
