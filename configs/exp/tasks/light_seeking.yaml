# @package _global_

# This task includes a goal and adversary. The goal and adversary are textured. The
# derived config must send `custom.frequency` to the frequency of the texture
# that should be applied to the objects. By default, the textures are synchronized
# between the goal and adversary, but this can be overridden by setting
# env.agents.<object name>.custom.frequency directly for each object.

defaults:
  - /exp/tasks/task

  # Use one maze for the time being
  - /env/mazes@env.mazes.maze: OPEN

  # Use the maze_exp config as the base
  - /exp/maze_exp

  # Define one point agent with a single eye
  - /env/agents@env.agents.agent: point
  - /env/agents/eyes@env.agents.agent.eyes.eye: eye

  # Define one goal light object
  - /env/agents@env.agents.goal: object_sphere_light
