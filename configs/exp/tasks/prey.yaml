# This task is supposed to resemble a prey-like scenario, where an adversarial object
# is chasing the agent.

defaults:
  - /exp/tasks/task

  # Use one maze for the time being
  - /env/mazes@env.mazes.maze: OPEN

  # Use the maze_exp config as the base
  - /exp/maze_exp

  # Define one agent which will be trainable
  - /env/agents@env.agents.agent: point

  # Define an adversarial predator which tries to catch the agent

  # Define a goal which the prey tries to reach
