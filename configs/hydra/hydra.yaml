  # Issue here is that the hydra.sweep.dir is created before the config file is fully
  # resolved. This is an issue because ${logdir} is part of the config which hasn't
  # been resolved. We set it explicitly to the value of logdir instead to get around
  # this. NOTE: this may fail in the future if logdir changes.
